Requirements:
  - Print messages in your transcript showing that the scoreboard is performing comparison on 32-bit data
  - The current testbench prints out the randomized value of num_char. This should correlate with the number of comparisons in your simulation
  - Email the transcript as proof of your completion. Be specific in the email subject whether you are working on Inbound or Outbound or both.
